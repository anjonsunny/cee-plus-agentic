"""The intervention, step 2: open a finished run, pick one hazard, give the
edited scene, run ONLY the after side.

    a finished run (the before side, read from its saved files)
        -> pick a hazard            (the frozen arm's ranked candidates)
        -> the edit instructions    (the frozen arm's text, mode "never happened")
        -> caption / image / both   (what was changed on the input)
        -> the after run            (a normal run of ours on the edited input)
        -> measure                  (agentic/intervention4.py, frozen numbers)

The edit is made by hand (Sunny, 2026-11-13: "by hand first, to test the
pipeline"). `edit_source` on a try says who made it ("hand"); an automatic
edit can later fill the same slot. Every try is appended to
interventions.json in the BEFORE run's folder and never rewritten
(no-erasure); a try that could not be measured is saved with its reason.

Pure helpers here; the Dash wiring is in ui.py. Nothing here builds a
prompt for the subject model: the instructions are for the person (or the
outside image tool) making the edit, and they are the frozen arm's words.
